## 📘 About Eurobot Junior

**Eurobot Junior** is an international educational robotics competition designed for participants **8–18 years old**.
Teams must design and build **remote-controlled or wire-controlled robots** that complete missions defined by a yearly theme.

The competition promotes:

* Hands-on engineering and STEM learning
* Teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving
* Fair play, cooperation, and knowledge sharing
* Presentation skills through posters and documentation
* Innovation in mechanical and electronic design

Eurobot Junior events include **national qualifiers** and the **international finals**, bringing together young robotics teams from across Europe and beyond.

## 🎯 Objectives of Team Johannes Gutenberg

Our goals as a team:

1. **Learn by Engineering**
   Build robots using mechanical design, electronics, control systems, and problem-solving.

2. **Encourage Teamwork & Creativity**
   Collaborate like an engineering team — planning, prototyping, testing, and iterating.

3. **Actively Participate in Eurobot Events**

   * Prepare documentation and posters
   * Homologate the robot according to official rules
   * Compete in national and international rounds

4. **Develop Strong Game Strategies**
   Combine reliability, efficiency, and creativity to complete the yearly missions.

5. **Grow as Future Engineers**
   Embrace engineering thinking: improve through testing, learn from failures, and document progress.

## 🚀 Eurobot Junior 2025 — *“The Show Must Go On”*

The 2025 theme is inspired by organizing a **large charity concert**.
Robots must perform tasks related to setting up and running a show, such as:

* Preparing the concert hall
* Promoting the event
* Performing “showtime” actions
* Organizing or storing stage tools
* Estimating or managing ticket sales

All missions are **independent**, meaning teams can choose their own strategy without mandatory tasks or a required order.
This pushes teams to design flexible, reliable mechanisms and a clear game plan.

## ❄️ Eurobot Junior 2026 — *“Winter Is Coming”*

The 2026 theme focuses on preparing for winter.
Typical missions (based on the theme and official game rules) include:

* Handling or transporting winter-related objects
* Preparing the field for seasonal changes
* Completing tasks safely and efficiently despite time limitations

2026 introduces new constraints and gameplay mechanics based around the winter scenario, requiring:

* Strong strategic planning
* Simple and robust mechanisms
* Careful reading of the general rules and homologation requirements

## 🛠 How We Work

Our development cycle:

### 1. **Ideation & Planning**

* Analyze rules
* Brainstorm strategies
* Assign team roles (mechanics, electronics, operator, documentation, etc.)

### 2. **Prototyping**

* Build basic movement system
* Test manipulators and mechanisms
* Evaluate different design ideas

### 3. **Documentation**

* Create the required project poster
* Write technical documentation for homologation
* Maintain this repository as our development log

### 4. **Testing & Refinement**

* Run practice matches
* Identify weak points
* Improve stability and performance

### 5. **Competition**

* Robot homologation
* Participation in national qualifiers
* International finals (if qualified)

### 6. **Reflection**

* Evaluate our performance
* Document lessons learned
* Begin early planning for the next season
